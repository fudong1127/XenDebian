KNOW PROBLEMS:
- cannot control disk size
- password type in plain text


TO DO:

- add option to pass all variables from file
- more documentation
- move provisioning (at least part of it) to main file
- remove  default settings for some variables
** preseed file
** mirror addreess
** root password
and add nice option to handle it.
- handle password nicer (from commandline).
- better (more dynamic created pressed file).
