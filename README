INFORMATION:

This python script allows unattended install of Debian (and probably
derivatives using preseed files) onto XenServer (and any other Linux
distribution using XAPI).

It is also an example of XenAPI usage, which hopefully will help others
to use XenAPI with python.


PREREQUISITES
python


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
- XenTools installation depends on disk numbering,
- information about VM should be the last variable in commandline,
- installation target has to be local disk. 


TO DO
- add option to pass variables from a batch file,
- have a config file with static values (like repository address),
- give a choice of network interface(s),
- better (more dynamic) creation of a preseed file,
- add option to set disk destination (local vs share storage),
- add option to add more disk,
- better handling situation with one server in a pool 
   (value for -m equal -s).


TO DO IN DERIVATE PROGRAM
- refactor code or rewrite the whole script as more object-oriented,
- ensure that script can install different distribution and OSes.
