KNOWN PROBLEMS:

- XenTools installation depends on disk numbering,
- list of OS to install depends hardcoded,
- installation target has to be local disk.

TO DO:

- add option to pass all variables from a file,
- more documentation,
- give choice of network interface(s),
- better (more dynamic) created pressed file,
- add option to set disk destination (local vs share storage),
- add option to control disk size.
