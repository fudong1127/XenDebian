INFORMATION:

This python script allows unattended install of Debian (and probably derivatives using preseed files) onto XenServer (and any other Linux distribution using XAPI).

It is also an example of XAPI usage, which hopefully will help others to use XAPI with python.


PREREQUISITES
python


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
- memory limits are not properly set,
- XenTools installation depends on disk numbering,
- information about VM should be the last variable in commandline,
- installation target has to be local disk. 


TO DO
- improve memory set up,
- add option to pass variables from a batch file,
- have a config file with static values (like repository address),
- give a choice of network interface(s),
- better (more dynamic) creation of a preseed file,
- add option to set disk destination (local vs share storage),
- add option to add more disk,
- better handling situation with one server pool (-m=-s)


TO DO IN DERIVATE PROGRAM
- refactor code or rewrite the whole script as more object-oriented.
- ensure that script can install different distribution and OSes.
