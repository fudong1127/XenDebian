KNOWN PROBLEMS:

- XenTools installation depends on disk numbering,
- list of OS to install depends hardcoded. 

TO DO:

- add option to pass all variables from a file,
- more documentation,
- move provisioning (at least part of it) to the main file,
- better (more dynamic) created pressed file,
- add option to control disk size.
