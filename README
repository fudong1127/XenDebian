INFORMATION:

This python script allows unattended install of Debian (and probably
derivatives using preseed files) onto XenServer (and any other Linux
distribution using XAPI).

It is also an example of XenAPI usage, which hopefully will help others
to use XenAPI with python.


PREREQUISITES
python


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
- XenTools installation depends on disk numbering,
- installation target is local disk. 


TO DO
- give a choice of network interface(s),
- add option to set disk destination (local vs share storage),
- better handling situation with one server in a pool 
   (value for -m equal -s).

NICE TO HAVE 
- add option to pass variables from a batch file,

THINGS CAN BE DONE BY PUPPET AND SIMILAR TOOL
- add option to add more disk, 
- better (more dynamic) creation of a preseed file,

TO DO IN DERIVATE PROGRAM
- refactor code or rewrite the whole script as more object-oriented,
- ensure that script can install different distribution and OSes.
