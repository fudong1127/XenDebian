INFORMATION:

This python scripts allows automatically install Debian (and probably derivatives using preseed files) onto XenServer (and any Linux distribution).

It is an example of XAPI usage, which hopefully helps other to use XAPI with python.

PREREQUISITES 
python


KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

- XenTools installation depends on disk numbering,
- installation target has to be local disk.

TO DO:

- add option to pass all variables from a file,
- give choice of network interface(s),
- better (more dynamic) created pressed file,
- add option to set disk destination (local vs share storage),
- add option to add more disk,
- more documentation.
